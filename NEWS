ledgeR 0.5.3
============

* Removed ``include_cleared``, ``include_pending``, ``include_unmarked``, 
  ``convert_to_cost``, and ``convert_to_market_value`` arguments from ``register``.
  Added a new ``mark`` column to imported data frames with values ``"*"``, ``"!"``, or ``""``.
  Also added  new ``historical_cost`` and ``market_value`` columns (#6).
  Imported ``ledger`` files currently do not have a ``market_value`` column due to limitations in ``ledger csv``.
* Added ``flags`` arguments to ``register``.
* Wrote and exported S3 methods so can use ``rio::import`` to read in registers (#7).
* Now throws an error if required binaries not found (#8).
* Fixed bug in importing hledger or beancount files (now automatically casts ``amount`` field to numeric).
